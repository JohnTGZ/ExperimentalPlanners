# Introduction
This package is meant as a platform to experiment with implementing the following deterministic search planners from scratch: A*, D* Lite, Theta*and Djikstra. 

This is currently still a work in progress.

# Cost Calculators
There are 4 different cost metrics here: (L1 Cost, L2 Cost, Octile and Chebyshev), they inherit from the **CostCalculator** class.
